## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to helping you understand and apply the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++. Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful paradigm that allows you to model real-world entities as classes and interact with them using objects. Each program and exercise here is designed to reinforce your understanding of OOP principles.

## Classes and Objects

The foundation of OOP is based on classes and objects. In the 'classes' folder, you will find C++ programs that demonstrate how to define classes, create objects, and work with their attributes and methods. These programs will help you grasp the basics of OOP.

## Inheritance and Polymorphism

Inheritance and polymorphism are key aspects of OOP. The 'inheritance' folder contains C++ programs that showcase how to create class hierarchies, establish parent-child relationships, and achieve polymorphic behavior using virtual functions. Dive into these programs to master inheritance and polymorphism.

## Encapsulation and Abstraction

Encapsulation and abstraction contribute to the modular and organized design of OOP. The 'encapsulation' folder houses C++ programs that illustrate how to encapsulate data and behavior within classes, reducing external interference. Explore these programs to understand the significance of encapsulation and abstraction.

## Programs

The 'programs' folder continues to provide a variety of C++ programs, each now focusing on various OOP concepts. Some topics covered include:

- Constructors and Destructors
- Operator Overloading
- Function Overriding
- Access Modifiers (public, private, protected)

Feel free to delve into the 'programs' directory to gain practical insights into these OOP concepts.

## Exercises

The 'exercises' folder is enriched with problem-solving exercises that challenge you to apply OOP principles. From designing class hierarchies to implementing encapsulation strategies, these exercises will refine your OOP skills and boost your problem-solving abilities using C++.

## Getting Started

To embark on your journey of mastering Object-Oriented Programming in C++, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/780Noman/OPP-Programs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the 'classes', 'inheritance', 'encapsulation', 'programs', and 'exercises' directories to access the relevant content.

3. Choose a program or exercise that aligns with your learning goals. Open it in your preferred C++ development environment to explore and learn!
